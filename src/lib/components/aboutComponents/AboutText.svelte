<p>
	My name is Justin Lung I am 21 years old, born and raised in a small country called The
	Netherlands. Currently studying at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
</p>
<p>
	I started as a Front End Developer in 2018. Since then I have been dedicating my life to build
	beautiful digital products made with <span>React</span> and <span>Svelte</span> (also made some
	projects with <span>Vue.js</span> & <span>Nuxt.js</span> ðŸŽ‰). Iâ€™m never done with learning new things
	and hope to learn more along the road.
