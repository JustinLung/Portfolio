```

## Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to handle sensitive information like API keys and endpoints. These should be stored in a `.env` file at the root of the project. **Ensure that this file is not checked into source control.**

### Sample `.env` file:

```env
# GraphQL API Endpoint for DatoCMS
DATO_ENDPOINT=https://graphql.datocms.com/

# API Key for DatoCMS
DATO_API_KEY=your_dato_cms_api_key_here
```

### Usage in the project:

In the `client.ts` file, the environment variables are accessed as follows:

```typescript
// client.ts
import { GraphQLClient } from 'graphql-request';
import { getSdkWithHooks } from '@lib/generated/sdk';

const nextGraphQlClient = new GraphQLClient(process.env.DATO_ENDPOINT || '', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DATO_API_KEY}`,
  },
});

// Use this server side, it directly calls the Umbraco GraphQL endpoint
export const nextClient = getSdkWithHooks(nextGraphQlClient);
```

Make sure you add your actual `DATO_API_KEY` and `DATO_ENDPOINT` in the `.env` file before running the project.
