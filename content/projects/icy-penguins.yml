description: During the time of my studies at FDND, me and a friend of mine found out about nft’s. We were inspired by various projects throughout the blockchain and created our own nft-set. This nft-set was very unique and is handdrawn by us. We could’nt wait any longer after the design and made a static website for this nft.
