	<h1>Frontend Developer creating immersive websites.</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Justin Lung I am 21 years old, born and raised in a small country called The
		Netherlands. Currently studying at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started as a Front End Developer in 2018. Since then I have been dedicating my life to build
		beautiful digital products made with <span>React</span> and <span>Svelte</span> (also made some
		projects with <span>Vue.js</span> & <span>Nuxt.js</span> ðŸŽ‰). Iâ€™m never done with learning new things
		and hope to learn more along the road.
